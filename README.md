# Female Name Email Address Generation Script

**Introduction**

This script generates randomly generated female first name and last name combinations and concatenates them to any web address of the user's choice in an email address format, then outputs a .csv file with the respective names and pertaining email addresses.

**How it works**

The script randomly picks female names and last names from their respective text files (`firstnames.txt`) and (`lastnames.txt`), then concatenates the first three letters of name with a last name and finally a web address of the user's choice.
